This is the todo list, currently divided into:
- sprints (roughly related items for minor version rev)
- semi-organized lists of item details

Sprints:
- reorg rando worldmap into one city (rando worldmap and other unused zones to TROCK)
	- static worldmap becomes a city - or no worldmap at all?
		- What use is a city "worldmap"?  travel w/out going thru lvls
		- will there be multiple visits, or one-time-only?  Or market-central plus one-time onlies?
	- zones become city sections - inventory and nodegraph them
		- weird, fantasy violence, real violence, spooky/ghostly, mindfuck, actual phobias,
		- avoid stereotypes, fear of the unknown
		- random or psuedorandom layouts
		- on-the-fly random minizones - houses per area to loot; oneshot?

- NPC facing indicator
- Player visibility indicator
- NPC suspicion indicator (green-yellow-red, high alpha?)
	- print AI stat/e: "Aware", "suspicious", "patrolling",.... ?
- Mod AI - assure they change state normal/suspcious/active, then back down if not directly viewing - careful considering the back to normal shift
- Mod Awareness / AI tied to suspicion flag
- Sound - on Player:move, same precomp'd dist array as vis, if n > e.hearing then e.ai_suspicion++
- Smell - leaves a trail that decays (but never goes to zero) - ai can search surrounding grids for vals


Completed sprints:
- move to 1.5.10 source tree and test

---
old, reorg
---
Reorder these:
- research and note methods to add dread and horror
	- concern->nervousness (something *might* happen, but no real danger)->fear (you're sure *some*thing bad is going to happen)
	- dread - afraid of an event,thing, place you've seen before
	- terror - something bad *is* happening, but you cannot identify the cause / do not understand it
	- horror - fear elicited by something frightening you have seen
	- alarm - sudden appearance of something frightening
	- panic - extreme fear causing one to become unreasonable
- Story ==> hero's journey steps?  Not sure that's what we want for this game ... maybe

Semi-Organized todo:
High level
finalize the overall storyline, and sketch out the major bits needed, do the end (simplified end-to-end) then insert (then redo this todo)
	prison->sewer->graveyard->town->worldmap
	town is a dramatic break, very big, opportunity to practice, equip up, swipe stuff
		game adjusts to how much illegal done (wanted, reputation)
	reputation and faction reactions change the game
	npc chats -> quests and/or reputation / reaction changes, re-emprison (lose equip), etc
	large-scale famous acts (ie steal X's thing)
	overall has to be save the world

Consider these:
Climb walls?
Dodge
lift/push/pull body - needs "body"
ranged / subdual ?  Easy-ish, but not sure it fits the theme
	Maybe special case, like "put out light with arrow", "temp blind target"


Stats:
STR - carry loot, attacking
SPD - run - no, use DEX
TouCH - lockpick, pickpock - no use DEX
DEX - general touch, sep from Reaction
StealTH - sneak, hide - talent, not stat
AIM? or just DEX - aim, ranged, knockout - no use DEX

add lockpick gui (remember Policy)
	picking locks quickly and efficiently - player can also "take all the time he needs" and autopick
	lock - attributes, states
		attr:
			mfctr and series
			difficulty (1-100)
			level: X named:(ward/lever/wafer/pin/rotary/tubular/disc/magnet/etc)
			mechanisms: 1-5(?)
			features: spring, reset, trap, ...
		mfctr->certain attrs, series->difficulty, certain attrs
	tools - what toolset the player has equipped
		levels are named pick, skeleton key, thieve's tools, locksmith's tools, etc
		if tool lvl < lock lvl, ++diff
	actions - what can be done
	displays mfctr - if known (successful pick -> known), display other bits
	mfctr -> rnd name, always same type: warded, (1,2,3,4,5)(wafer,pin,lever,disc)tumbler, other "tech"
	displays tools: pick, key, other?
	solve each in order - each move takes a turn (during which you cannot see the screen)
	would be nice to have gfx, or at least color-coded status
	this might work:
    if self.bg_image then
        local fill = core.display.loadImage(self.bg_image)
        local fw, fh = fill:getSize()
        self.bg_surface = core.display.newSurface(w, h)
        self.bg_surface:erase(0, 0, 0)
        for i = 0, w, fw do for j = 0, h, fh do
            self.bg_surface:merge(fill, i, j)
        end end
        self.bg_texture, self.bg_texture_w, self.bg_texture_h = self.bg_surface:glTexture()
    end
