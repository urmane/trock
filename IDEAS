Policy: the rogue is someone who does things not supposed to be done

Thief: a thief steals things
get into places (means many types of barriers, secrets, alternates, tools)
not combat-heavy (means many/most combats not winnable, and effects pose challenges outside combat proper)
alternate combat - knockouts (and move/hide bodies, means enemies notice bodies), distract, gas/drug
avoid detection, and escape (means many ways to be detected, and ways to change/avoid/mitigate)
different ways/manners to move/hide/sneak/cover tracks
steal (or plant) items (means many types of things to take, hold, sell, deliver, fence, spend, etc.)
information (means have a specific "information" panel in the UI - treat (some) info as items)
information can be provided to zero or more people, to different effect
lots of secrets, hidden places/paths/items (means lots of search/conceal/hidden things)
bypass security (means lots of ways to protect valuables, and lots of tools to use on those protections)

Game concept:
Traditional is murder hobo:
- Explore everywhere to kill all npc and take their drops, looking for gold, xp, and better equips
- defeat bosses to expand the available area
ITS is similar but more tactical:
- Explore everywhere but avoid NPC, pick their pockets, surprise/sap them, open containers looking for gold, xp, and better equips
- normally no light carried, to avoid them seeing you
- avoid/steal from bosses' hoards
- kills later on?  Or indirect kills by movement/trickery/devices/items
- get information - static form (eg: book) is stolen plot item; dynamic is be at the right place at the right time (autogenerated plot item)
- mood/feel -> setting, players -> goals -> actions(direct,talents) -> tools (talent++, unique/trigger, new (rope=>climb))

Quests/main storylines (work backwards to assure no dissonant narrative)
- Win conditions:
	- Revenge - sacrifice much to kill big bad
	- Hero - do the right thing to capture/vanquish the big bad
	- God of Thieves - selfishly excel at all skills and do the things
- Quest Types ("thing" includes information)
	- bring the thing to the place
	- bring the thing to the guy
	- solve the puzzle at the place
	- use skills to enable / disable the mechanism
	- lots of quests, if graphed can intertwine

High level
finalize the overall storyline, and sketch out the major bits needed, do the end (simplified end-to-end) then insert (then redo this todo)
	prison->sewer->graveyard->town->worldmap
	town is a dramatic break, very big, opportunity to practice, equip up, swipe stuff
		game adjusts to how much illegal done (wanted, reputation)
	reputation and faction reactions change the game
	npc chats -> quests and/or reputation / reaction changes, re-emprison (lose equip), etc
	large-scale famous acts (ie steal X's thing)
	overall has to be save the world

Locations:
Church, Graveyard
Zombie Town
Asylum
Prison
Poor town / Greed town
Castle
Mansion(s) zones off of town
Person Collection Facility (bad things happen to people, addl use for body objects)
Design Guidance:
- dense utilization of space, dungeons not just empty space separating encounters

Senses
Smell - swimmy trail if visible
Sight - fuzzed edge (a la xbox Thief); fog, snow, gas smear for confusion, whiteout for flash
	Inconsistent lighting - variable, blinking (fast to slow), unreliable
	Monsters that move in the dark
	Effects of the dark/light
Sound - sound :-), heartbeat speed by HP
Touch - cannot do xbox-style force feedback or analog input
(taste?)

AI
state, action, things that change state, actor flags for fns to refer to to make choices
fns that encapsulate behaviors, and events that change to a different behavior
animal behaviors:
animal-stay, animal-wander, animal-patrol,
animal-defend, animal-pursue,
animal-flee, animal-flee-only
animal state changers: notice player(actor?), hp below injury_flee_pct

human behaviors:
human-stay, human-wander, human-patrol, human-fastmove, human-investigate,
human-defend, human-pursue,
human-flee, human-flee-only,
