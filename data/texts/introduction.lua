return [[Well, #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#, now you've done it.

The Town Guard was eerily efficient.  You have no idea how they found you, but find you they did, and dropped you in this damp cell.  That was a few weeks ago, best you can tell.  No sun down here to mark the days.

With nothing but time, you've been able to use the materials at hand - rat bones, bits of string from your rags, slime from the walls - to lubricate the hinges and the lock mechanism, and work it open.

There's no way you can make it out the entrance ... but perhaps there's another way out.  You wait for an opportunity, then ease the door open.  There should be a staircase down in the SouthEast of this floor.


Time to go.


And remember, stay ...

In The Shadows.
