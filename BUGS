General conditions:
WORKAROUND:
Emotes do not display
	npcs must have lite=1 at a minimum or be in a light pool
	engine.Map:displayEmotes checks seens(x,y), need to subclass Map and override?
	that's to have unseen NPCs emote, which seems reasonable ...
	will change later to can_hear() or heards(x,y)

FIXED:
player.sight and sight_min are not set right?  birth dtor error?
