The Return of Castle Kurok

Life has never treated you well.  For as long as you remember, you've had to fight for survival, with only your wits and your skill to keep you fed, keep you warm.

With the discovery of Castle Kurtok, coming to Mount Gora was a no-brainer.  Exploring the abandoned ruins of an ancient empire?  You could be rich ...

It didn't take long for you to learn the truth: it was a trap.  Slavers control the entrance to the underground complex, and they've built an arena around it where the rich watch the poor fight and die to ancient evils and unspeakable horrors.  Hope provides an endless stream of "contestants" for the press gangs to seize, most of whom nobody will miss.  You thought you were careful ... but this whole town is in on it, and one night your drink was drugged and a bag went over your head.

Now you must fight for your own survival.

But you've been playing this game your whole life.
